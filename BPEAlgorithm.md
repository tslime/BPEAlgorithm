# BPEAlgorithm


## 1. Introduction

This project provides an implementation of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) in Python and C++ from scratch. That is, this implementation minimally relies on existing libraries and builds the necessary data structure for the functioning of the algorithm from scratch. This project also provides a comparative analysis of the performance of the algorithm in both languages.
