# BPE Algorithm Implementation

A comprehensive implementation of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm from scratch in both Python and C++, designed for tokenization and vocabulary construction in natural language processing applications.

## üìã Overview

This project provides a clean, educational implementation of the Byte Pair Encoding algorithm originally developed by Gage (1994) for data compression, now widely used in modern language models for subword tokenization. The implementation includes custom data structures built from scratch to demonstrate the core concepts.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Language Implementation**: Complete implementations in both Python and C++
- **From-Scratch Design**: Custom data structures including hash tables, heaps, and linked lists
- **Educational Focus**: Clear, well-commented code suitable for learning and demonstration
- **Performance Analysis**: Comparative analysis between Python and C++ implementations
- **Interactive Demo**: Command-line interface for testing the algorithm

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Data Structures

The implementation consists of several key components:

- **Token-ID Hashtable**: Maps tokens to unique identifiers
- **ID-Token Hashtable**: Reverse mapping from IDs to tokens  
- **Max Heap**: Tracks token pair frequencies for merge operations
- **Linked Lists**: Efficient token sequence management

### Algorithm Phases

1. **Single Character Tokenization**: Initial breakdown into character-level tokens
2. **Frequency Calculation**: Count adjacent token pair frequencies
3. **Iterative Merging**: Merge most frequent pairs and update data structures
4. **Vocabulary Construction**: Build final token vocabulary

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Python Implementation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the algorithm
cd Python
python3 BPEAlgorithm.py
```

### C++ Implementation

```bash
# Compile the program
cd C++
g++ -I./inc -o bpe_algorithm BPEAlgorithm.cpp

# Run the algorithm
./bpe_algorithm
```

## üìñ Usage Example

```python
# Example input
text = "hello world hello"

# The algorithm will:
# 1. Tokenize: [['h','e','l','l','o','_'], ['w','o','r','l','d','_'], ['h','e','l','l','o','_']]
# 2. Find most frequent pair: ('h','e') appears twice
# 3. Merge: [['he','l','l','o','_'], ['w','o','r','l','d','_'], ['he','l','l','o','_']]
```

## üìä Performance Analysis

The implementation includes performance comparison between Python and C++ versions:

- **Memory Usage**: Custom data structures vs. built-in collections
- **Processing Speed**: Language-specific optimizations
- **Scalability**: Performance with different text sizes
